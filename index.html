                Coheed and Cambria have been one of my favorite bands for years. They are a progressive/alternative rock band.
                My wife and I have listened to them together ever since we first started dating, and we have been fans ever since.
                We have seen them in concert more times than I can count over the years.
                Coheed and Cambria have been around since the early 2000s, and have released 9 albums.
                Most of the albums and songs are about a sci-fi story, and the main characters are what the band is named after.
