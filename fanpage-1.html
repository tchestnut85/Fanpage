        <h1>Coheed and Cambria fansite!</h1>

        <p style="color:blue;">Coheed and Cambria have been one of my favorite bands for years. They are a progressive/alternative rock band.
        My wife and I have listened to them together ever since we first started dating, and we have been fans ever since. We have seen them in concert more times than I can count over the years.
        Coheed and Cambria have been around since the early 2000s, and have released 9 albums. Most of the albums and songs are about a sci-fi story, and the main characters are what the band is named after.
